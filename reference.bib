	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a mental illness characterized by manic and depressive episodes. The inability to track the patient at different stages of the disease, the patient’s concealment of information, and the difficulty in obtaining and paying for a psychologist are all weaknesses in traditional diagnosis procedures. In this regard, computer researchers have developed automated prediction algorithms in response to issues involved in using traditional ways of diagnosing bipolar disorder. Although these automated approaches have eliminated many problems that plagued previous systems, there are still many challenges to tackle. Discovering a mechanism to track changes in user behavior and aggregating various features into a cohesive model are the most critical issues in this context. To address these concerns, this research proposes a novel approach for detecting bipolar disorder among Twitter users.},

We introduce the SMHD (Self-reported Mental Health Diagnoses) dataset and make it available.

We examine distinctions in users’ language, as measured by linguistic and psychological variables. We further explore text classiﬁcation methods to identify individuals with mental conditions through their language.},

However, previous efforts in the area have been limited by the lack of data and contextually relevant information. There is a need for largescale, well-labeled mental health datasets with fast reproducible methods to facilitate their heuristic growth. In this paper, we cater to this need by building the Twitter - SelfReported Temporally-Contextual Mental Health Diagnosis Dataset (Twitter-STMHD), a large scale, user-level dataset grouped into 8 disorder categories and a companion class of control users. The dataset is 60\% hand-annotated, which lead to the creation of high-precision self-reported diagnosis report patterns, used for the construction of the rest of the dataset. The dataset, instead of being a corpus of tweets, is a collection of user-proﬁles of those suffering from mental health disorders to provide a holistic view of the problem statement. By leveraging temporal information, the data for a given proﬁle in the dataset has been collected for disease prevalence periods: onset of disorder, diagnosis and progression, along with a fourth period: COVID-19. This is the only and the largest dataset that captures the tweeting activity of users suffering from mental health disorders during the COVID-19 period.},

Despite yielding rich, dense and high fidelity data, current sensing technologies often require highly engineered study designs and persistent participant compliance, making them difficult to scale to large populations and to data acquisition tasks spanning extended time periods. This paper situates social media as a new passive, unobtrusive sensing technology. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning framework to combine small samples of data gathered through active sensing, with large-scale social media data to infer mood instability (MI) in individuals. Starting from a theoretically-grounded measure of MI obtained from mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), we show that our model is able to infer MI in a large population of Twitter users with 96\% accuracy and F-1 score. Additionally, we show that, our model predicts self-identifying Twitter users with bipolar and borderline personality disorder to exhibit twice the likelihood of high MI, compared to that in a suitable control. We discuss the implications and the potential for integrating complementary sensing capabilities to address complex research challenges in precision medicine.},

In general, the main challenge of mental disorders is that they remain difﬁcult to detect on suffering patients. In an online environment, the challenge extends to the collection of patients data and the implementation of proper algorithms to assist in the detection of such illnesses. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection mechanism and build predictive models that leverage language and behavioral patterns, used particularly on Twitter, to determine whether a user is suffering from a mental disorder. After training the predictive models, they are further pre-trained to serve as the back-end for our demonstration, MIDAS.

            The number of people affected by mental illness is on the increase and with it the burden on health and social care use, as well as the loss of both productivity and quality-adjusted life-years. Natural language processing of electronic health records is increasingly used to study mental health conditions and risk behaviours on a large scale. However, narrative notes written by clinicians do not capture first-hand the patients’ own experiences, and only record cross-sectional, professional impressions at the point of care. Social media platforms have become a source of ‘in the moment’ daily exchange, with topics including well-being and mental health. In this study, we analysed posts from the social media platform Reddit and developed classifiers to recognise and classify posts related to mental illness according to 11 disorder themes. Using a neural network and deep learning approach, we could automatically recognise mental illness-related posts in our balenced dataset with an accuracy of 91.08\% and select the correct theme with a weighted average accuracy of 71.37\%. We believe that these results are a first step in developing methods to characterise large amounts of user-generated content that could support content curation and targeted interventions.},

The latter include attempting to identify posts that need urgent attention due to their nature, e.g. when someone announces their intentions of ending their life by suicide or harming others. Our results show that there are a variety of linguistic features that are discriminative across mental health user communities and that can be further exploited in subsequent classiﬁcation tasks. Furthermore, while negative sentiment is almost uniformly expressed across the entire data set, we demonstrate that there are also condition-speciﬁc vocabularies used in social media to communicate about particular disorders.

Automated analysis of text related to mental health is aimed to help medical decision-making, public health policies and to improve health care. Such analysis may involve text classiﬁcation. Traditionally, automated classiﬁcation has been performed mainly using machine learning methods involving costly feature engineering. Recently, the performance of those methods has been dramatically improved by neural methods. However, mainly Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been explored. In this paper, we apply a hierarchical Recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism on social media data related to mental health. We show that this architecture improves overall classiﬁcation results as compared to previously reported results on the same data. Beneﬁtting from the attention mechanism, it can also efﬁciently select text elements crucial for classiﬁcation decisions, which can also be used for in-depth analysis.},

Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.},

In order to prevent this problem, many researchers looked into social media to ﬁgure out depressed individuals by analyzing the differences in language use. While they have recently achieved reasonable performance in detecting depression, especially using deep learning methods, such methods still do not provide a clear way to explain why certain individuals have been detected as depressed. To address this issue, we propose Feature Attention Network (FAN), inspired by the process of diagnosing depression by an expert who has background knowledge about depression. We evaluate the performance of our model on a large scale general forum (Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that FAN shows good performance with high interpretability despite a smaller number of posts in training data. We investigate different aspects of posts by depressed users through four feature networks built upon psychological studies, which will help researchers to investigate social media posts to ﬁnd useful evidence for depressive symptoms.},
